# Overview {.unnumbered}
DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5524600 

The aim was to prepare a spatio-temporal representation of valuation studies related to biodiversity and ecosystem services and ... .

# Creation of the Corpus
## Methodology 
  
## Description of the corpus 
  
# Georeferencing the Corpus

To identify country names in the corpus of literature a two step approach was used. First, we wanted to understand where studies were conducted and searched the title, abstract, and keywords of each paper for country names. Second, to understand where the funding institutions were located we searched the affiliations, acknowledgments, and funding text for country names.

The input data we used are the following:

-   Bib file downloaded from Web of Science

-   ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes (<https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html>)

-   IPBES regional and subregional area dataset (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3923633>)

The python code used to georeference the corpus can be found [here](https://github.com/ellentatia/Pilot_case2). An overview of the pipeline is provided in the following schematic and described below.

```{r overview-fig, fig.align = 'center', out.width="75%", fig.cap = "Overview of the process of Georeferencing the corpus of valuation studies"}
knitr::include_graphics("pilot2.svg")
```

Step 1: *Extract country names from text* 
Country names were extracted from the title, abstract, and keywords of each paper with a regular expression and the associated ISO code was added into a a column in the dataset. The same regular expression was also used to search the affiliations, acknowledgments, and funding text of the same paper and placed into a second column.

Step 2 and 3: *Bundle countries in regions and subregions*
The IPBES Regions and Subregions datatset was then used to add additional region and subregion attributes to the dataset by matching the ISO3 code.

Step 4: *Find TS accordingly* 
We used a set of files to add additional attributes to the dataset that identified the topics. The set of files contained identifying information for papers derived from sets of web of science searches targeting particular topics. This identifying information was then matched to the corpus, and the topic extracted.

Finally, the complete corpus with the added attributes of country ISO codes of both funding institutions and research locations, and topic identification were used as the basis of the rest of the research project. The complete corpus can be found on Zenodo here: [https://doi.org/[INSERT](https://doi.org/%5BINSERT){.uri} DOI]

# Valuation Maps
The complete georeferenced valuation corpus was used to understand the location of valuation studies throughout the world and the location of the institutions conducting those studies. 

We counted the number of times a country was listed in the corpus from the column of country names obtained from the title, abstract, and keywords search as a proxy for the density of valuation studies. in Part 4 - Indicator Analysis this is referred to as "Names 1". 

Separately, we counted the number of times a country was listed in the corpus from the column of country names obtained from the affiliations acknowledgments, and funding text as a proxy for the density of institutions. In Part 4 - Indicator Analysis this is referred to as "Names 2"

## Geographic Distribution
We will now present the results from the analysis through a series of maps showing both the raw country results and summarized by IPBES regions and subregions. No data is always displayed in grey.

# Indicator Analysis

The [IPBES Core Indicators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439411) were used alongside a chosen set of other relevant indicators to understand geographic trends between density of valuation studies and how they relate to biological and socioeconomic indicators.

## Selection of Indicators

We used all the most recent year of the IPBES Core Indicators available within the [country dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439411) except for two indicators, Countries/Regions with Active NBSAP and Category 1 nations in CTIES, as these are binary in the dataset and would not be compatible with the following analysis. We selected a specific category from the indicators with multiple categories. For example, for the indicator "Area of forest production under FSC and PEFC certification" we chose the FSC certification area and not the PEFC certification area.

A set of other indicators were included in the analysis to expand the coverage of socioeconomic variables. We included the [human development index (HDI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506#), [average harmonized learning outcomes score](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/learning-outcomes-vs-gdp-per-capita), [gross domestic product (GDP)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/MK), [corruption perception index (CPI)](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl), and [population](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/OA).

These datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and had ISO3 codes added to easily merge them into the analysis. The latest data available was used for each indicator.

Here is the table of all of the indicators used, the category selected, the year the data is from, and the number assigned to them.

There were a few instances of duplicated values which were double checked with the original dataset and the erranous value removed. Examples include having two values for USA due to the separation of Hawaii in the original dataset. In these cases Hawaii was removed and the value referring to the rest of the states of the country was used instead. Additionally, Indicator 9, Region-based Marine Trophic Index, the mean of the regions was calculated per country, as countries such as Germany have multiple regions with distinct values.

## Dataset Compilation

To understand how valuation is spread across geographies, we counted the number of times each country's ISO code appeared in the corpus for both geography columns added in step 2. The result is the density of studies per country and the density of funding institutions per country for the entire corpus.

The external indicators were also joined onto the dataset to analyze the relationships between these socioeconomic indicators and the density of studies and funding institutions.

This process was also repeated with an additional filter that excluded any studies published before 2010.

## Pearson Correlation Analysis

To investigate the relationships between indicators and the number of valuation studies, we ran a pearson correlation analysis. The statistical analysis calculated the trends between the number of studies in each country (Names 1) and the number of studies funded in each country (Names 2) and each of the indicators. The results are shown below.

Insignificant relationships are blank, significant relationships (*P \< 0.01*) are shown with circles. The strength of the correlation corresponds to the size of the circle and the color represents positve (blue) or negative (red) trends.

```{r pearson, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pearson correlations of geographic valuation studies and indicators"}
knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Pearson_correlation_table/correlation_figure.png")
```

The same pearson correlation analysis with the indicators was conducted on the log of the number of studies in each country (Names 1) and the log of the number of studies funded from each country (Names2).

```{r pearson-log, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pearson correlations of log geographic valuation studies and the indicators"}
knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Pearson_correlation_table/correlation_figure_log.png")
```

## Individual Trend Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The individual trends between each indicator and the number of studies and number of funding institutions are shown here for the entire corpus. For each indicator, there are two four panel figures with the top figure showing the trends with the raw values, and the bottom figure displaying the trends with log transformed x-axis values.

The dots represent countries within the dataset that have values for both the indicator and valuation atlas. The associated p value of the linear trend model is shown in the corner of the image in red. The trend line is shown in blue and the associated standard error in grey. Please note that the y axis is not necessarily consistent between the four boxes and may include values that aren't actually found in the data to showcase the full extent of the standard error of the trend line.

For each figure the panels are arranged accordingly:

-   Names 1 (top-left) is the number of valuation studies for each country in the corpus

-   Names 1 from 2010 (top-right) is the number of valuation studies for each country in the corpus from 2010 to 2020

-   Names 2 (bottom-left) is the number of valuation studies funded from each country in the corpus

-   Names 2 from 2010 (bottom-right) is the number of valuation studies funded from each country in the corpus from 2010 to 2020
