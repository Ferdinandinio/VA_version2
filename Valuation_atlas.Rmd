# The Corpus

The maps and analyses in this section are based on a corpus of 79,040 studies in the published scientific literature. The corpus is shared between chapter 3 and 4 of the values assessment. For more information about the corpus see IPBES VA Chapter 3. Systematic review on Method Families (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4404436>) and IPBES VA Chapter 4. Systematic review on valuation uptake (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4391335>).

# Georeferencing the Corpus

To identify country names in the corpus of literature a two step approach was used. First, we wanted to understand where studies were conducted and searched the title, abstract, and keywords of each paper for country names. Second, to understand where the funding institutions were located we searched the affiliations, acknowledgments, and funding text for country names.

The input data we used are the following:

-   Bib file downloaded from Web of Science

-   ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country (includes some territories) codes (<https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html>)

-   IPBES regional and subregional area dataset (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3923633>)

The python code used to georeference the corpus can be found [here](https://github.com/ellentatia/Pilot_case2). An overview of the pipeline is provided in the following schematic and described below.

```{r overview-fig, fig.align = 'center', out.width="75%", fig.cap = "Overview of the process of Georeferencing the corpus of valuation studies"}
knitr::include_graphics("pilot2.svg")
```

Step 1: *Extract country names from text* Country names were extracted from the title, abstract, and keywords of each paper with a regular expression and the associated ISO code was added into a a column in the dataset. The same regular expression was also used to search the affiliations, acknowledgments, and funding text of the same paper and placed into a second column.

Step 2 and 3: *Bundle countries in regions and subregions* The IPBES Regions and Subregions datatset was then used to add additional region and subregion attributes to the dataset by matching the ISO3 code.

Step 4: *Find TS accordingly* We used a set of files to add additional attributes to the dataset that identified the topics. The set of files contained identifying information for papers derived from sets of web of science searches targeting particular topics. This identifying information was then matched to the corpus, and the topic extracted. For more details on topic identification please see chapter 4 systematic review on valuation uptake (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4391335>).

Finally, the complete corpus with the added attributes of country ISO codes of both funding institutions and research locations, and topic identification were used as the basis of the rest of the research project. The complete corpus can be found on Zenodo here: [[https://doi.org/[INSERT](https://doi.org/%5BINSERT](https://doi.org/%5BINSERT%5D(https://doi.org/%5BINSERT){.uri}){.uri} DOI]

# Valuation Maps

The complete georeferenced valuation corpus was used to understand the location of valuation studies throughout the world and the location of the institutions conducting those studies.

We counted the number of times a country or territory was listed in the corpus from the column of country or territory names obtained from the title, abstract, and keywords search as a proxy for the density of valuation studies.

Separately, we counted the number of times a country or territory was listed in the corpus from the column of country or territory names obtained from the affiliations acknowledgments, and funding text as a proxy for the density of institutions.

```{r results='asis', warning=FALSE}

n <- nrow(data)

  mutate(x = strsplit(as.character(CountryName_TI_AB_DE_ID), ", ")) %>%
  unnest(x) %>% 
  count(x, sort = TRUE)

  filter(is.na(x)) 

t_names2 <- data %>% 
  mutate(x = strsplit(as.character(CountryName_CI_FU_FX), ", ")) %>%
  unnest(x) %>% 
  count(x, sort = TRUE)

```

## Geographic Distribution

We will now present the results from the analysis through a series of maps showing both the raw country or territory results and summarized by IPBES regions and subregions. No data is always displayed in grey. The darker green values represent higher density of studies, while the darker blue values represent higher density of institutions.

### Density of studies {.tabset .tabset-pills}

#### All {.unnumbered}

Showcases the number of valuation studies conducted within each country or territory for **the entire dataset**. Please note that the scales are not consistent between maps.

There were `r sum(t$n) - studies_na$n` identifications of a country or territory from the title, abstract, or keywords, consisting of `r nrow(t) - nrow(studies_na)` countries or territories identified.

The United States has disproportionately higher valuation studies than other countries. In descending order, United States (10.96%), China (6.66%), Australia (5.36%), Brazil (4.66%) and India (3.74%) have the highest valuation studies in total and for studies post 2010.

There was a large relative increase of valuation studies conducted in China before 2010 and after 2010. Before 2010, China comprised of 2.80% of the valuation studies, but after 2010 China comprised 8.04% of the valuation studies.

## Relationships between density of studies and institutions

OECD member countries and middle-income countries broadly had relatively more studies in their countries relative to research and funding affiliations; also Greenland, the Antarctic, some Latin American and Asian, most African countries had relatively more research and funding affiliations compared to the number of studies in their countries. Countries mostly in the southern hemisphere had a disproportionate number of researchers engaged in ecosystem services/NCP assessment studies, relative to the number of studies carried out in their country, in comparison to Northern hemisphere countries. Because these are ratios, it is better to consider them in the light of country/population size. From a Southern-country perspective, this could indicate: (i) high frequency of collaboration outside their own countries of researchers from countries in the South, and (ii) underfunding of domestic valuation studies in countries of the South relative to the number of domestic researchers and funding agencies. From the perspective of countries in the North this could indicate (i) relatively limited research collaboration outside their country for researchers from the North, and (ii) well-funded ecosystem services/NCP research relative to number of researchers and funding affiliations. From both these perspectives the narrative is of a relative export of ecosystem services/NCP research capacity from Southern countries to other countries. The data may also simply show a relative deficit of ecosystem services/NCP study applications in the South relative to the North. No data was found on cross-border flows of funding or researchers to make any further interpretation. This is a potential knowledge gap. More analysis is needed on whether there are patterns in relation to ecosystem assessment method families, and whether the patterns have changed over time. There are many exceptions to the broad global pattern which merit country-specific studies of the institutional context of ecosystem assessment to identify barriers and successful leverage points.

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Maps/Names1Names2_map.png")
```

It is clear that there is a significant positive linear relationship between the density of studies and institutions. It is important to note that there were many more identified countries for institutions than location of studies.

knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Corpus/Names1_Names2.png")
```

## Temporal Trends

The timeline for the study application in the georeferenced countries shows a relatively uniform distribution of scientific literature in English across IPBES regions in the decade of the 1990s. The decade of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005-2015) saw a relative concentration of ecosystem services/NCP studies in a few countries (US, Brazil, India, UK). The decade including studies produced by The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity - TEEB study (2008-2018) saw further concentration on those countries, and some diversification to EU countries, African countries and China. A hypothesis arising from this descriptive data is 'first starter advantage' in generating valuation capacity with the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, with notable exceptions such as China and South Africa.

Finally, there has been an exponential increase in valuation studies from the 1980's to the present as pictured in the graph below.

```{r, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Corpus/Timeline.svg")
```

-   569 studies did not have a year identified
-   Data from 2020 was removed due to incomplete sampling of 2020.

# Indicator Analysis

The [IPBES Core Indicators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439411) were used alongside a chosen set of other relevant indicators to understand geographic trends between density of valuation studies and how they relate to biological and socioeconomic indicators.

## Selection of Indicators

We used all the most recent year of the IPBES Core Indicators available within the [country dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439411) except for two indicators, Countries/Regions with Active NBSAP and Category 1 nations in CTIES, as these are binary in the dataset and would not be compatible with the following analysis. We selected a specific category from the indicators with multiple categories. For example, for the indicator "Area of forest production under FSC and PEFC certification" we chose the FSC certification area and not the PEFC certification area.

A set of other indicators were included in the analysis to expand the coverage of socioeconomic variables. We included the [human development index (HDI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/137506#), [average harmonized learning outcomes score](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/learning-outcomes-vs-gdp-per-capita), [gross domestic product (GDP)](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/MK), [corruption perception index (CPI)](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2020/index/nzl), and [population](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/OA).

These datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and had ISO3 codes added to easily merge them into the analysis. The latest data available was used for each indicator.

Here is the table of all of the indicators used, the category selected, the year the data is from, and the number assigned to them.

There were a few instances of duplicated values which were double checked with the original dataset and the erroneous value removed. Examples include having two values for USA due to the separation of Hawaii in the original dataset. In these cases Hawaii was removed and the value referring to the rest of the states of the country was used instead. Additionally, Indicator 9, Region-based Marine Trophic Index, the mean of the regions was calculated per country, as countries such as Germany have multiple regions with distinct values.

## Dataset Compilation

To understand how valuation is spread across geographies, we counted the number of times each country's or territories' ISO code appeared in the corpus for both geography columns added in step 2. The result is the density of studies per country or territory and the density of funding institutions per country or territory for the entire corpus.

The external indicators were also joined onto the dataset to analyze the relationships between these socioeconomic indicators and the density of studies and funding institutions.

This process was also repeated with an additional filter that excluded any studies published before 2010.

## Pearson Correlation Analysis

To investigate the relationships between indicators and the number of valuation studies, we ran a pearson correlation analysis. The statistical analysis calculated the trends between the number of studies in each country or territory (Density of studies) and the number of studies funded in each country or territory (Density of institutions) and each of the indicators. The results are shown below.

Insignificant relationships are blank, significant relationships (*P \< 0.01*) are shown with circles. The strength of the correlation corresponds to the size of the circle and the color represents positive (blue) or negative (red) trends.

*Description of results*

There is a very strong positive relationship between GDP and the density of both studies and institutions. GDP per capita does not exhibit the same strong correlation.

Density of studies is also strongly positively correlated to total wood removals, trends in pesticide use, population, nitrogen fertilizers, and water footprint index.

Density of institutions is also strongly positively correlated with total wood removals, and nitrogen fertilizers.

While most significant relationships are positive, there are two negative relationships present. Biodiversity inexactness index is negatively correlated with both the density of studies and institutions, and protected area management effectiveness is slightly negative correlated with the density of institutions.

```{r pearson, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Pearson correlations of geographic valuation studies and indicators"}
knitr::include_graphics("Outputs/Pearson_correlation_table/correlation_figure.png")
```

The same pearson correlation analysis with the indicators was conducted on the log of the number of studies in each country or territory and the log of the number of studies funded from each country.

*Description of results*

Generally, the log density of studies and institutions show stronger and more correlations with the indicators. Within the log relationship, the protected area management effectiveness becomes significantly negatively correlated with both the density of studies and institutions. The biodiversity inexactness index also follows the same pattern.

For the log density of studies compared to the non-transformed density of studies, GDP becomes less strongly correlated, local breeds at risk of extinction becomes positively correlated, protected area connectedness index becomes strongly positively correlated, species protection index becomes positively correlated, as well as trends in forest extent, and nitrogen deposition trends.

For the log density of institutions compared to the non-transformed density of institutions, the human development index, average harmonized learning outcomes, corruption perception index, population, and local breeds at risk of extinction all become more strongly positively correlated, while the GDP becomes slightly less positively correlated. Additionally, the percentage of undernourished people becomes negatively correlated with the log density of studies, the species protection index and the species status information index become positively correlated, and finally the relationship to trends in pesticide use is no longer significant.

For both the log density of studies and institutions, the protected area connected index becomes strongly positively corrrelated.

## Individual Trend Analysis {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The individual trends between each indicator and the number of studies and number of funding institutions are shown here for the entire corpus. For each indicator, there are two four panel figures with the top figure showing the trends with the raw values, and the bottom figure displaying the trends with log transformed x-axis values.

The dots represent countries within the dataset that have values for both the indicator and valuation atlas. The associated p value of the linear trend model is shown in the corner of the image in red. The trend line is shown in blue and the associated standard error in grey. Please note that the y axis is not necessarily consistent between the four boxes and may include values that aren't actually found in the data to showcase the full extent of the standard error of the trend line.

There are some broad narratives emerge from this analysis:

-   Fewer studies are being carried out in countries with extreme poverty.

-   More ecosystem service/NCP assessment studies are being carried out where biodiversity and environmental degradation is higher and protection lower.

-   More studies are being carried out where natural capital is the highest and the conservation discourse is more advanced.

Some contradictions between these single variable narratives exist, such as more ecosystem services/NCP assessments carried out in countries with a lower protected area effectiveness index, and in countries with a higher species protection index, while these are significantly negatively correlated across countries. There is a knowledge gap and no robust understanding can be concluded on this.

For each figure the panels are arranged accordingly:

-   Density of studies (top-left) is the number of valuation studies for each country or territory in the corpus

-   Density of studies from 2010 (top-right) is the number of valuation studies for each country or territory in the corpus from 2010 to 2020

-   Density of institutions (bottom-left) is the number of valuation studies funded from each country or territory in the corpus

-   Density of institutions from 2010 (bottom-right) is the number of valuation studies funded from each country or territory in the corpus from 2010 to 2020
